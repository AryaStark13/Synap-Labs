11. Rollout Approach
    How will we execute this rollout? Big-bang or gradual scale-up? A/B test or launch-and-measure? 
    Will the rollout happen in every market at once, or will markets ramp up one by one?
    Be inclusive of other key Product Development Team members in having this discussion, in particular Data Analysts, Data Science and Business Ops, along with Developers.
    Provide a comprehensive view into the Pros/Cons, what can/cannot be answered as a result, and reasoning behind the decision being made for the rollout approach. 

12. Measuring Success
    If A/B testing, describe the variants being tested, traffic allocations to each variant, and the KPIs being measured in the experiment. 
    Describe the desired cadence of performance readouts and align with Analytics to ensure it’s covered.
    As with the Rollout Approach section, please be sure to socialize this plan with your partners in Analytics, Data Science and Business Operations.
