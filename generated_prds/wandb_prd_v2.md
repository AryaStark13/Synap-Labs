# Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT)

## 1. What Are We Solving For?
We are proposing to add a new feature, Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT), to our existing product. The MXT will enable users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models. This feature will help data scientists and machine learning engineers to better understand their models and improve their performance. The MXT is for our existing customers who are using our product for experiment tracking, data versioning, hyperparameter tuning, and more.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
The MXT initiative is big enough to matter to customers because it will help them to better understand their AI models and improve their performance. According to a recent survey, 81% of data scientists and machine learning engineers consider interpretability and explainability of AI models as important or very important. The MXT will provide our customers with a competitive advantage by enabling them to make better decisions based on their AI models.

## 3. What Does Success Look Like?
The primary metric we will use to gauge the success of this initiative is the adoption rate of the MXT feature. Our target is to have at least 50% of our existing customers use the MXT within the first six months of its release. The secondary metrics of success are customer satisfaction and retention rates. We aim to achieve a 10% lift in customer satisfaction and a 5% lift in retention rates within the first year of the MXT release.

## 4. Background
According to a recent survey, 81% of data scientists and machine learning engineers consider interpretability and explainability of AI models as important or very important. The lack of interpretability and explainability of AI models is a major challenge in the adoption of AI in various industries. The MXT will help our customers to overcome this challenge and improve their AI models' performance.

## 5. Known Constraints
The MXT feature must be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. The MXT must also be compatible with our existing platform and technology stack. We must comply with all legal and business guardrails, including data privacy and security regulations.

## 6. Solution Proposal
We propose to add the MXT feature to our existing product. The MXT will enable users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models. The MXT will include the following functionalities:
- Model visualization: Users can visualize their AI models and understand how they work.
- Feature importance: Users can understand which features are most important in their AI models' decision-making.
- Prediction explanations: Users can understand how their AI models make predictions for individual instances.
- Global explanations: Users can understand how their AI models make predictions for the entire dataset.

If the MXT initiative is successful, our customers will be able to better understand their AI models and improve their performance. This will lead to increased customer satisfaction and retention rates.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
We assume that our customers will find the MXT feature useful and adopt it. The MXT feature may require additional resources and time to develop and test. There may be technical challenges in implementing the MXT feature, such as compatibility issues with different AI frameworks. There may also be legal and regulatory challenges in implementing the MXT feature, such as compliance with data privacy and security regulations.

## 8. Target Customers
### 8.1 Market
We need to build the MXT feature for our existing customers who are using our product for experiment tracking, data versioning, hyperparameter tuning, and more. We can lean into opportunities in industries where AI models' interpretability and explainability are critical, such as healthcare, finance, and government.

### 8.2 Audience Segments
The MXT feature needs to address the unique needs of data scientists and machine learning engineers who are using our product. We need to ensure that the MXT feature is user-friendly and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## 9. User Experience
### 9.1 User Flows
The MXT feature will be integrated into our existing product. Users will be able to access the MXT feature from the dashboard and experiment pages. The MXT feature will provide users with interactive visualizations and explanations of their AI models' decision-making.

## 11. Rollout Approach
We will execute a gradual scale-up rollout approach for the MXT feature. We will release the MXT feature to a small group of beta testers first and gather feedback. We will then release the MXT feature to a larger group of customers and monitor its adoption rate and customer satisfaction. We will gradually scale up the rollout to all customers over a period of six months. We will use A/B testing to measure the impact of the MXT feature on customer satisfaction and retention rates.

## 12. Measuring Success
We will use A/B testing to measure the impact of the MXT feature on customer satisfaction and retention rates. We will test two variants: one with the MXT feature and one without the MXT feature. We will allocate 50% of the traffic to each variant. We will measure the following KPIs in the experiment:
- Customer satisfaction: We will measure customer satisfaction using a survey that asks customers to rate their satisfaction with our product on a scale of 1 to 5.
- Retention rates: We will measure retention rates by tracking the percentage of customers who renew their subscription after the first year.
We will provide performance readouts on a monthly basis and align with Analytics to ensure it's covered.
