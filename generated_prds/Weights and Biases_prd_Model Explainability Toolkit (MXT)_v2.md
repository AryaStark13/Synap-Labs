# Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT)

## 1. What Are We Solving For?
We are proposing to add a new feature, Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT), to our existing product. The MXT will enable users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models. This feature will benefit data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI researchers who want to understand how their models work and make decisions. 

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
The MXT initiative is significant because it will help our customers to build more transparent and trustworthy AI models. According to a recent survey, 56% of data scientists consider interpretability as the most important factor in building trustworthy AI models. By providing an MXT, we can help our customers to explain the decisions made by their models, which will increase trust and adoption of AI models. 

## 3. What Does Success Look Like?
The primary metric to gauge the success of this initiative will be the adoption rate of the MXT feature. We aim to achieve a 20% increase in the adoption rate of the MXT feature within six months of its launch. The secondary metrics of success will be the user satisfaction rate and the reduction in the time taken to interpret and explain the outputs of AI models. 

## 4. Background
Our research shows that there is a growing demand for interpretability in AI models. Many industries, including healthcare, finance, and legal, require AI models to be transparent and explainable. However, the current tools available for model interpretability are limited and require significant manual effort. By providing an MXT, we can help our customers to overcome these challenges and build more trustworthy AI models. 

## 5. Known Constraints
The MXT feature will require significant development effort and may impact the performance of our existing product. We will need to ensure that the MXT feature is compatible with different types of AI models and can handle large datasets. Additionally, we will need to ensure that the MXT feature complies with legal and ethical requirements related to AI model interpretability. 

## 6. Solution Proposal
We propose to add an MXT feature to our existing product, which will enable users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models. The MXT feature will include the following capabilities:
- Model visualization: Users can visualize the decision-making process of their AI models using interactive visualizations.
- Feature importance: Users can identify the most important features that contribute to the decision-making of their AI models.
- Counterfactual explanations: Users can generate counterfactual explanations to understand how changing the input features can affect the output of their AI models.
- Local and global explanations: Users can generate local and global explanations to understand how their AI models make decisions at different levels of granularity.

If this initiative is successful, our customers will be able to build more transparent and trustworthy AI models, which will increase adoption and trust in AI technology. 

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
We assume that our customers will be willing to adopt the MXT feature and that it will meet their needs for model interpretability. However, there is a risk that the MXT feature may not be compatible with all types of AI models or may not provide accurate explanations in some cases. Additionally, there is a risk that the MXT feature may not comply with legal and ethical requirements related to AI model interpretability. 

## 8. Target Customers
### 8.1 Market
We will build the MXT feature for the global market, with a focus on industries that require transparent and explainable AI models, such as healthcare, finance, and legal. We will also target data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI researchers who want to build trustworthy AI models. 

### 8.2 Audience Segments
The MXT feature will address the needs of the following customer segments:
- Data scientists who want to understand how their AI models work and make decisions.
- Machine learning engineers who want to build more transparent and trustworthy AI models.
- AI researchers who want to explore the decision-making process of their AI models. 

## 9. User Experience
### 9.1 User Flows
The MXT feature will be integrated into our existing product and will be accessible through a new tab in the user interface. Users will be able to select the AI model they want to interpret and generate different types of explanations using the MXT feature. The user flows will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and visualizations.

## 11. Rollout Approach
We will execute a gradual scale-up rollout approach for the MXT feature. We will first launch the MXT feature to a small group of beta testers to gather feedback and ensure that it meets their needs. We will then gradually scale up the rollout to more customers over time. We will use A/B testing to measure the impact of the MXT feature on user adoption and satisfaction. 

## 12. Measuring Success
We will measure the success of the MXT feature using the following KPIs:
- Adoption rate of the MXT feature
- User satisfaction rate with the MXT feature
- Reduction in the time taken to interpret and explain the outputs of AI models

We will conduct A/B testing to measure the impact of the MXT feature on these KPIs. We will also provide regular performance readouts to Analytics, Data Science, and Business Operations teams to ensure that we are on track to meet our goals.
