# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. What Are We Solving For?
We are proposing the addition of a Model Training Wizard (MTW) feature to provide a user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of training their own custom language models. This feature aims to solve the problem of users lacking the knowledge or expertise to train their own language models, and the opportunity to empower users to create high-quality models tailored to their specific needs. This feature is targeted towards users who want to train their own language models and need step-by-step instructions, dataset management tools, and performance evaluation metrics.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
This initiative matters because it enables customers to have more control and customization over their language models. By providing a user-friendly interface and guidance, users who previously lacked the knowledge or expertise can now train their own models. This empowers users to create models that are specifically tailored to their needs, resulting in higher-quality models. The importance of this initiative is supported by customer feedback and studies that highlight the demand for customizable language models.

## 3. What Does Success Look Like?
The primary metric to gauge the success of this initiative is the number of users who successfully train their own custom language models using the Model Training Wizard. The target lift for this metric is a 20% increase in the number of users training custom models within 6 months of launching the feature. 

The secondary metrics of success include:
- User satisfaction with the Model Training Wizard, measured through surveys and feedback.
- Reduction in support requests related to model training, indicating improved user self-sufficiency.
- Increase in the usage of custom language models in user applications, indicating successful integration and adoption.

## 4. Background
Research and analysis have shown that many users struggle with training their own language models due to the complexity and lack of guidance. Competitor analysis has revealed that some platforms offer similar features, but they lack user-friendliness and comprehensive guidance. Customer insights have highlighted the demand for customizable language models and the need for a user-friendly interface to facilitate the training process. This background research supports the need for the Model Training Wizard feature.

## 5. Known Constraints
- Usability: The solution should be accessible and intuitive for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- Time: The feature should be developed and launched within the next 6 months to meet market demand.
- Technology: The solution should leverage existing platform capabilities and ensure optimal site performance.
- Legal: The feature should comply with relevant data privacy and security regulations.
- Business: The solution should align with the company's strategic goals and financial constraints.

## 6. Solution Proposal
The proposed solution is to develop a Model Training Wizard (MTW) feature that provides a user-friendly interface to guide users through the process of training their own custom language models. The feature will include the following:
- Step-by-step instructions: Clear and concise instructions to help users understand and follow the training process.
- Dataset management tools: Tools to manage and preprocess datasets, including data cleaning, labeling, and augmentation.
- Performance evaluation metrics: Metrics to evaluate the performance of trained models, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Customization options: Options to customize model architecture, hyperparameters, and training settings.
- Error handling and troubleshooting: Guidance and support for common errors and issues encountered during training.

If this initiative is successful, customers will have a user-friendly and guided experience in training their own custom language models. This will result in higher-quality models that are tailored to their specific needs, leading to improved user satisfaction and increased adoption of custom language models.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
Risks:
- Fraud/abuse potential: The feature may be misused for malicious purposes, requiring robust security measures and monitoring.
- Security: The handling of user data during the training process should be secure and comply with privacy regulations.

Assumptions:
- Users have access to sufficient computing resources for training language models.
- Users are willing to invest time and effort in training their own models.
- The provided step-by-step instructions and guidance will be sufficient for users to successfully train their models.

## 11. Rollout Approach
The rollout approach for the Model Training Wizard feature will involve a gradual scale-up. The feature will be initially launched as a beta version to a limited set of users, allowing for feedback and iterative improvements. A/B testing will be conducted to compare the performance and user satisfaction of the Model Training Wizard with the existing manual training process. The rollout will happen in multiple markets simultaneously, with a focus on regions with high demand for customizable language models. The approach will be aligned with key stakeholders, including Data Analysts, Data Science, and Business Ops, to ensure a comprehensive and successful rollout.

## 12. Measuring Success
The success of the Model Training Wizard feature will be measured through A/B testing. The variants being tested include the existing manual training process (control group) and the Model Training Wizard (experimental group). Traffic will be allocated to each variant in a 50:50 ratio. The key performance indicators (KPIs) being measured in the experiment include the number of users successfully training custom models, user satisfaction scores, support request reduction, and usage of custom language models in user applications. Performance readouts will be conducted on a monthly basis, and the plan will be shared with Analytics, Data Science, and Business Operations to ensure comprehensive coverage and alignment.
