# Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT) Feature PRD

## 1. What Are We Solving For?
We are proposing to add a new feature to the Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT) that enables users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI Models. This feature aims to address the problem of lack of transparency and interpretability in AI models, which can hinder user trust and adoption. The target audience for this feature includes data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI practitioners who want to gain insights into how their models make decisions. 

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
This initiative is significant because it empowers customers to understand and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models. By providing interpretability and explainability, users can gain insights into the factors influencing their models' predictions, identify biases or errors, and improve the overall trustworthiness of their AI systems. Studies have shown that interpretability is crucial for regulatory compliance, ethical considerations, and user acceptance of AI models.

## 3. What Does Success Look Like?
The primary metric to gauge the success of this initiative will be the increase in user satisfaction with model interpretability. We aim to achieve a target lift of 20% in user satisfaction within six months of launching the new feature. The secondary metrics of success include an increase in user engagement with the MXT feature, a decrease in user-reported issues related to model interpretability, and positive feedback from users regarding the usefulness and effectiveness of the feature.

## 4. Background
Extensive research and industry analysis have highlighted the importance of model interpretability and explainability. Many AI models, such as deep neural networks, are often considered black boxes due to their complex architectures and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency can lead to challenges in understanding and trusting the outputs of these models. Competitors in the market have started offering similar explainability features, and customer feedback indicates a strong demand for interpretability tools.

## 5. Known Constraints
- Usability: The solution should be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- Time: The solution should be developed and launched within six months to meet market demand and stay competitive.
- Technology: The solution should leverage existing platform capabilities and ensure optimal site performance.
- Legal: The solution should comply with relevant data privacy and security regulations.
- Business: The solution should align with the company's strategic goals and financial constraints.

## 6. Solution Proposal
- Develop a user-friendly interface within the MXT that allows users to visualize and explore the decision-making process of their AI models.
- Provide feature importance rankings, highlighting the factors that contribute most to the model's predictions.
- Offer explanations for individual predictions, showcasing the key features and patterns that influenced the model's decision.
- Enable users to compare and contrast different models' outputs and decision-making processes.
- Provide interactive tools for users to experiment with input variations and observe the corresponding changes in model predictions.
- Improve the documentation and educational resources to help users understand and effectively utilize the interpretability features.

If this initiative is successful, customers will have a better understanding of their AI models' decision-making, leading to improved trust, model refinement, and overall better decision-making based on AI outputs.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
- Assumption: Users have access to the necessary data and model information required for interpretability analysis.
- Risk: The interpretability features may not be applicable to all types of AI models or may have limitations in certain scenarios.
- Risk: The interpretability features may introduce additional complexity and cognitive load for users, potentially impacting usability.
- Risk: The explanations provided by the feature may not always be accurate or may be misinterpreted by users, leading to incorrect conclusions.

## 11. Rollout Approach
The rollout approach for this feature will be a gradual scale-up. We will initially launch the feature as a beta version to a select group of users, including power users and early adopters. Their feedback and usage data will be collected to iterate and improve the feature. Once the beta version is stable and refined, we will gradually expand the availability to a wider user base. A/B testing will be conducted to measure the impact of the feature on user satisfaction and engagement. The rollout will happen in multiple markets simultaneously, with a focus on regions with high AI adoption.

## 12. Measuring Success
The A/B testing variants will include a control group without the interpretability feature and a test group with the feature enabled. The traffic allocation will be 50% to each variant. The key performance indicators (KPIs) to be measured in the experiment include user satisfaction, user engagement with the MXT feature, and user-reported issues related to model interpretability. Performance readouts will be conducted monthly, and the results will be shared with the Analytics, Data Science, and Business Operations teams for analysis and further decision-making.
