# Product Requirement Document (PRD) for AuroPay Payments Gateway

## 1. What Are We Solving For?
We are proposing the addition of AuroPay Payments Gateway to our existing product to facilitate easy transfer of money between merchants and customers. This feature will benefit both our banking and ticket booking customers who need a secure and reliable payment gateway to complete their transactions.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
This initiative matters because it will improve the overall customer experience by providing a seamless and secure payment gateway. According to a recent study, 63% of customers abandon their online transactions due to a lack of payment options. By adding AuroPay, we can reduce the number of abandoned transactions and increase customer satisfaction.

## 3. What Does Success Look Like?
The primary metric we will use to gauge the success of this initiative is the conversion rate of completed transactions. We aim to achieve a 10% lift in completed transactions within the first 3 months of launching AuroPay. The secondary metrics of success include customer satisfaction, repeat usage, and revenue growth.

## 4. Background
Our research shows that customers are looking for a secure and reliable payment gateway to complete their transactions. Our competitors, such as RazorPay, have already established themselves in the market and are gaining traction. By adding AuroPay, we can stay competitive and meet the needs of our customers.

## 5. Known Constraints
We need to ensure that AuroPay is compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements. We also need to ensure that the payment gateway is accessible to all customers, including those with disabilities. Additionally, we need to ensure that the platform can handle high volumes of transactions without any performance issues.

## 6. Solution Proposal
We propose adding AuroPay Payments Gateway to our existing product. The payment gateway will be integrated with our bank account and ticket booking systems, allowing customers to complete their transactions seamlessly. AuroPay will offer a range of payment options, including credit/debit cards, net banking, and UPI. Customers will also have the option to save their payment details for future transactions, making the process even more convenient.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
We assume that customers will trust AuroPay as a secure and reliable payment gateway. However, there is a risk of fraud and abuse, which we need to mitigate through robust security measures. We also need to ensure that the platform is scalable and can handle high volumes of transactions without any performance issues.

## 11. Rollout Approach
We will execute a gradual scale-up rollout approach, starting with a soft launch in a few markets to test the platform's performance and gather customer feedback. We will then gradually ramp up the rollout to other markets based on the feedback and performance metrics. We will also conduct A/B testing to measure the impact of AuroPay on completed transactions and customer satisfaction.

## 12. Measuring Success
We will measure the success of AuroPay by tracking the conversion rate of completed transactions, customer satisfaction, repeat usage, and revenue growth. If A/B testing, we will test variants such as payment options, user interface, and pricing. We will provide regular performance readouts to the Analytics, Data Science, and Business Operations teams to ensure alignment and make data-driven decisions.
