# Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT)

## 1. What Are We Solving For?
We are proposing the addition of a Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT) to enable users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI Models. The problem we are solving is the lack of transparency and interpretability of AI models, which can lead to mistrust and skepticism from users. This feature is for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and other technical users who want to understand how their AI models are making decisions.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
This initiative is important because it addresses a critical need for transparency and interpretability in AI models. Studies have shown that lack of transparency is a major barrier to adoption of AI models, and can lead to mistrust and skepticism from users. By providing a toolkit for model explainability, we can increase trust and confidence in AI models, and enable users to make more informed decisions.

## 3. What Does Success Look Like?
The primary metric for success of this initiative is user adoption and satisfaction with the MXT feature. We aim to achieve a 20% increase in user adoption of the MXT feature within 6 months of launch. Secondary metrics of success include increased user engagement with AI models, improved accuracy and performance of AI models, and reduced time and effort required for model interpretation and explanation.

## 4. Background
Research has shown that lack of transparency and interpretability is a major barrier to adoption of AI models. This is particularly true in regulated industries such as healthcare and finance, where users need to understand how decisions are being made. There are several existing tools and techniques for model explainability, including LIME, SHAP, and Integrated Gradients. However, these tools can be complex and difficult to use, and there is a need for a more user-friendly and accessible toolkit.

## 5. Known Constraints
The MXT feature must be designed with usability and accessibility in mind, to ensure that it is easy to use and understand for technical users. The feature must also be compatible with a wide range of AI models and platforms, and must comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

## 6. Solution Proposal
We propose the development of a Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT) that will enable users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models. The MXT will include the following features:
- Visualizations and explanations of model inputs and outputs
- Tools for feature importance analysis and attribution
- Integration with popular AI platforms and frameworks
- User-friendly interface and documentation

If this initiative is successful, users will have a better understanding of how their AI models are making decisions, which will increase trust and confidence in the models. This will lead to increased adoption and engagement with AI models, and improved accuracy and performance.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
