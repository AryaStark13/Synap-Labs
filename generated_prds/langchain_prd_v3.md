# Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Model Training Wizard (MTW)

## 1. What Are We Solving For?
We are proposing the addition of a Model Training Wizard (MTW) feature to our product. The MTW will provide a user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of training their own custom language models. This feature is for users who need to create high-quality models tailored to their specific needs.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
This initiative matters because it will provide our users with a powerful tool to create custom language models. This will improve the accuracy and relevance of their models, leading to better outcomes. We have conducted customer research that shows a strong demand for this feature.

## 3. What Does Success Look Like?
The primary metric we will use to gauge the success of this initiative is the number of users who create custom language models using the MTW. Our target is to have 50% of our users create at least one custom language model using the MTW within the first six months of launch. The secondary metrics of success are user satisfaction and retention rates.

## 4. Background
Our research shows that many of our users need to create custom language models to meet their specific needs. However, the process of training these models can be complex and time-consuming. The MTW will simplify this process and provide users with the tools they need to create high-quality models.

## 5. Known Constraints
The MTW must be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. We must also ensure that the MTW is compatible with all major platforms and devices. Additionally, we must comply with all relevant legal and business requirements.

## 6. Solution Proposal
We propose adding a Model Training Wizard (MTW) feature to our product. The MTW will provide step-by-step instructions, dataset management tools, and performance evaluation metrics to help users create high-quality models tailored to their specific needs. If this initiative is successful, our users will be able to create more accurate and relevant language models, leading to better outcomes.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
We assume that our users will find the MTW easy to use and that it will meet their needs. However, there is a risk that the MTW may not be able to meet the needs of all users. Additionally, there is a risk of fraud or abuse if users are able to create models that are harmful or offensive.

## 8. Target Customers
### 8.1 Market
We need to build the MTW for all regions and countries where our product is available. We can lean into opportunities in regions where there is a high demand for custom language models.
### 8.2 Audience Segments
The MTW will be useful for users in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and legal. It will also be useful for users who need to create models in multiple languages.

## 9. User Experience
### 9.1 User Flows
The MTW will be accessed through a new tab in our product. Users will be guided through the process of creating a custom language model, with step-by-step instructions and performance evaluation metrics.

## 10. High Level Use Cases:

## 11. Rollout Approach
We will execute a gradual scale-up rollout of the MTW, starting with a small group of beta testers and gradually expanding to all users. We will use A/B testing to measure the impact of the MTW on user engagement and retention. We will work closely with our partners in Analytics, Data Science, and Business Operations to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the rollout approach.

## 12. Measuring Success
We will measure the success of the MTW using A/B testing. We will test the impact of the MTW on user engagement and retention, with traffic allocated to the MTW variant and the control variant. We will measure the primary metric of success (number of users who create custom language models using the MTW) and the secondary metrics of success (user satisfaction and retention rates). We will provide regular performance readouts to our partners in Analytics, Data Science, and Business Operations.
