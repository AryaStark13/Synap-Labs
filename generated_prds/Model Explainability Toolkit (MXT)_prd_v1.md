# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview:
The Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT) is a project aimed at enabling users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI Models. The purpose of this project is to provide users with a tool that enhances the transparency and understanding of AI models, allowing them to gain insights into how the models arrive at their predictions or decisions. By addressing the lack of interpretability in AI models, MXT aims to build trust and confidence in the use of AI technology.

## 2. Project Scope:
The project includes the development of a toolkit that integrates with existing AI models and provides users with the ability to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of these models. The toolkit will support various types of AI models and will be compatible with popular frameworks and platforms. However, the project does not include the development of new AI models or modifications to the existing models.

## 3. Functional Requirements:
- Integration: The toolkit should be able to integrate with a wide range of AI models, including but not limited to deep learning models, machine learning models, and natural language processing models.
- Interpretability Metrics: The toolkit should provide users with interpretability metrics that quantify the level of interpretability of their AI models.
- Feature Importance: The toolkit should enable users to identify and understand the importance of different features or inputs in the decision-making process of their AI models.
- Rule Extraction: The toolkit should allow users to extract rules or decision trees from their AI models, providing a more understandable representation of the models' decision-making process.
- Visualization: The toolkit should provide visualizations that help users understand and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models.
- Documentation: The toolkit should include comprehensive documentation that guides users on how to interpret and explain their AI models effectively.

## 4. Non-functional Requirements:
- Performance: The toolkit should have minimal impact on the performance of the AI models it integrates with.
- Security: The toolkit should ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the AI models and their outputs.
- Usability: The toolkit should have a user-friendly interface and be accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- Scalability: The toolkit should be able to handle large-scale AI models and datasets efficiently.

## 5. Use Cases:
- Use Case 1: A data scientist wants to understand why a deep learning model misclassified certain images and needs to identify the features that contributed most to the misclassification.
- Use Case 2: A business analyst wants to explain the decision-making process of a machine learning model used for credit scoring to comply with regulatory requirements.
- Use Case 3: An AI researcher wants to compare the interpretability of different AI models to determine which model is more suitable for a specific use case.

## 6. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Guidelines:
- The UI should be intuitive and provide clear navigation to different features and functionalities.
- Visualizations should be visually appealing and easy to interpret.
- The toolkit should provide informative tooltips and contextual help to guide users in interpreting and explaining their AI models effectively.

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints:
- The toolkit assumes that users have access to the AI models they want to interpret and explain.
- The toolkit is constrained by the limitations of the AI models it integrates with, such as the availability of interpretability methods for specific types of models.

## 8. Technical Requirements:
- The toolkit should be compatible with popular AI frameworks and platforms, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
- The toolkit should be able to handle large datasets efficiently.
- The toolkit should support both on-premises and cloud-based deployments.

## 9. Timeline and Milestones:
- Milestone 1: Requirements Gathering and Analysis (2 weeks)
- Milestone 2: Development of Interpretability Metrics and Feature Importance (4 weeks)
- Milestone 3: Development of Rule Extraction and Visualization (6 weeks)
- Milestone 4: Documentation and Testing (2 weeks)
- Milestone 5: Deployment and Release (2 weeks)

## 10. Success Criteria:
- The toolkit is successfully integrated with at least three popular AI frameworks.
- Users report a significant improvement in their ability to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models.
- The toolkit receives positive feedback from users regarding its usability and effectiveness in enhancing model explainability.

## 11. Customer Analysis:
The customers who would use this feature include:
- Data scientists and AI researchers who want to gain insights into the decision-making process of their AI models.
- Business analysts and domain experts who need to explain the outputs of AI models to stakeholders or comply with regulatory requirements.
- AI model auditors and ethics committees who require interpretability to assess the fairness, bias, and ethical implications of AI models.
