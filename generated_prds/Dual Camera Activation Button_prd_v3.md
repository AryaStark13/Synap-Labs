# Product Requirement Document (PRD) - Dual Camera Activation Button

## 1. What Are We Solving For?
We are proposing the addition of a Dual Camera Activation Button feature that enables users to capture photos from both front and back cameras simultaneously. This feature is aimed at enhancing the photography experience for users who want to capture moments from multiple perspectives. It will benefit users who enjoy taking selfies or group photos and want to include the background scenery as well.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
This initiative matters because it provides users with a unique and convenient way to capture photos using both front and back cameras simultaneously. According to market research, there is a growing demand for advanced camera features in smartphones. By offering this feature, we can differentiate our product from competitors and attract users who value enhanced photography capabilities.

## 3. What Does Success Look Like?
The primary metric to gauge the success of this initiative will be the increase in user engagement with the camera feature. We aim to achieve a 20% lift in the number of photos captured per user over a three-month period. The secondary metrics of success include an increase in user satisfaction with the camera feature, positive user reviews, and an increase in user retention.

## 4. Background
Based on customer feedback and industry research, users often express the desire to capture photos using both front and back cameras simultaneously. Competitor analysis shows that some smartphone brands already offer this feature, which has been well-received by users. Additionally, user surveys indicate that a significant portion of our target audience values advanced camera capabilities and would be interested in using this feature.

## 5. Known Constraints
- The solution should be compatible with the existing hardware and software capabilities of our smartphones.

## 11. Rollout Approach
The rollout approach for this feature will be a gradual scale-up. We will initially launch the feature as an A/B test in a select market to gather user feedback and measure its impact on user engagement and satisfaction. Based on the results, we will refine the feature and gradually roll it out to other markets. This approach allows us to mitigate risks and make data-driven decisions throughout the rollout process.

## 12. Measuring Success
For the A/B test rollout, we will have two variants: Variant A with the Dual Camera Activation Button enabled and Variant B without the feature. We will allocate 50% of the traffic to each variant and measure the following KPIs:
- Number of photos captured per user
- User satisfaction with the camera feature
- User retention rate

Performance readouts will be conducted on a weekly basis, and the results will be shared with the Analytics, Data Science, and Business Operations teams to ensure comprehensive coverage and alignment.
