# Product Requirement Document: Dual Camera Activation (DCA)

## 1. What Are We Solving For?
We are proposing the addition of a Dual Camera Activation (DCA) feature to Instagram. This feature will enable users to activate both cameras of their phone simultaneously for more cool looking photos. The problem we are solving for is the lack of options for users to take unique and creative photos on Instagram. This feature is for all Instagram users who want to take more interesting and creative photos.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
This initiative matters because it will provide users with a new and unique way to take photos on Instagram. According to our research, users are always looking for new and creative ways to take photos on Instagram. This feature will provide them with a new option to do so. Additionally, this feature will help Instagram stay competitive in the social media market by providing users with a unique feature that is not currently available on other social media platforms.

## 3. What Does Success Look Like?
The primary metric we will use to gauge the success of this initiative is the number of users who use the DCA feature. Our target lift/impact is a 10% increase in the number of users who use the feature within the first 3 months of launch. The secondary metric of success is the number of photos taken using the DCA feature.

## 4. Background
Our research has shown that users are always looking for new and creative ways to take photos on Instagram. Additionally, we have seen that other social media platforms have been adding new and unique features to their platforms to stay competitive. We believe that the addition of the DCA feature will help Instagram stay competitive and provide users with a new and unique way to take photos.

## 5. Known Constraints
The DCA feature will only be available on phones that have two cameras. Additionally, we will need to ensure that the feature is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## 6. Solution Proposal
We propose adding a button to enable both cameras of the phone simultaneously for more cool looking photos. This feature will be available in the camera section of the app. If this initiative is successful, users will have a new and unique way to take photos on Instagram.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
We assume that users will be interested in using the DCA feature. The risk is that users may not find the feature useful or may not have phones with two cameras.

## 8. Target Customers
### 8.1 Market
The DCA feature will be available to all Instagram users worldwide.
### 8.2 Audience Segments

## 9. User Experience

## 11. Rollout Approach
We will execute a gradual scale-up rollout of the DCA feature. We will start with a small group of users and gradually increase the number of users who have access to the feature. We will also A/B test the feature to ensure that it is working properly and that users are interested in using it.

## 12. Measuring Success
We will measure the success of the DCA feature by tracking the number of users who use the feature and the number of photos taken using the feature. We will also conduct A/B testing to measure the impact of the feature on user engagement. We will provide performance readouts on a weekly basis and work closely with Analytics, Data Science, and Business Operations to ensure that we are measuring success accurately.
