# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview
The Model Training Wizard (MTW) is a new feature that Langchain aims to add to its existing suite of products. The purpose of this feature is to provide users with a user-friendly interface that guides them through the process of training their own custom language models. The MTW will provide step-by-step instructions, dataset management tools, and performance evaluation metrics to help users create high-quality models tailored to their specific needs.

## 2. Project Scope
The MTW feature will include the following:
- A user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of training their own custom language models.
- Dataset management tools to help users manage their data.
- Performance evaluation metrics to help users evaluate the quality of their models.

The MTW feature will not include the following:
- Pretrained LLMs.
- Prompt templates.
- Memory.
- Text splitters.
- Chain multiple prompts and LLMs together.
- Drive decision-making processes using LLMs.

## 3. Functional Requirements
The MTW feature should deliver the following functionalities:
- A user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of training their own custom language models.
- Dataset management tools to help users manage their data.
- Performance evaluation metrics to help users evaluate the quality of their models.
- Ability to save and load models.
- Ability to fine-tune models.
- Ability to export models.

## 4. Non-functional Requirements
The MTW feature should meet the following criteria:
- Performance: The MTW feature should be fast and responsive.
- Security: The MTW feature should be secure and protect user data.
- Usability: The MTW feature should be easy to use and understand.
- Scalability: The MTW feature should be able to handle large datasets.

## 5. Use Cases
The following scenarios describe how users will interact with the MTW feature:
- A user wants to train a custom language model for a specific task. They open the MTW feature and follow the step-by-step instructions to train their model.
- A user wants to fine-tune an existing model. They open the MTW feature, load their model, and use the fine-tuning tools to improve their model's performance.
- A user wants to export their model. They open the MTW feature, select their model, and export it in the desired format.

## 6. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Guidelines
The MTW feature should follow these design principles and requirements for the user interface:
- The interface should be clean and uncluttered.
- The interface should be easy to navigate.
- The interface should provide clear instructions and feedback.
- The interface should be consistent with Langchain's existing products.
