# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview
The Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT) is a new feature that will be added to Weights and Biases, a leading AI startup specializing in experiment tracking, data versioning, hyperparameter tuning, and much more. The purpose of this project is to enable users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models. This feature will help users gain insights into how their models work and make better decisions based on those insights.

## 2. Project Scope
The MXT feature will include the following:
- Ability to explain the outputs and decision-making of AI models
- Integration with existing Weights and Biases features
- User-friendly interface for easy interpretation of model outputs
- Compatibility with popular machine learning frameworks

The following are excluded from the project scope:
- Integration with non-popular machine learning frameworks
- Support for non-AI models

## 3. Functional Requirements
The MXT feature should deliver the following functionalities:
- Ability to generate feature importance plots
- Ability to generate partial dependence plots
- Ability to generate SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots
- Ability to generate LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) plots
- Ability to generate model performance metrics
- Ability to compare different models based on their interpretability

## 4. Non-functional Requirements
The MXT feature should meet the following criteria:
- Performance: The feature should be fast and responsive, even with large datasets.
- Security: The feature should be secure and protect user data.
- Usability: The feature should be easy to use and understand.
- Scalability: The feature should be able to handle large datasets and models.

## 5. Use Cases
The following are detailed scenarios that describe how users will interact with the MXT feature:
- A data scientist wants to understand which features are most important in their model's decision-making process.
- A machine learning engineer wants to compare the interpretability of different models to choose the best one for their use case.
- A business analyst wants to understand how their model's outputs are affected by different input variables.

## 6. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Guidelines
The MXT feature should follow these design principles and requirements for the user interface:
- The interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
- The interface should provide clear explanations of the different plots and metrics.
- The interface should be customizable to allow users to choose which plots and metrics to display.

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints
The following factors or limitations may impact the development or implementation of the MXT feature:
- The feature will only be compatible with popular machine learning frameworks.
- The feature will require significant computational resources to generate the plots and metrics.

## 8. Technical Requirements
The MXT feature will require the following technologies, platforms, or infrastructure:
- Integration with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
- High-performance computing resources to generate the plots and metrics.

## 9. Timeline and Milestones
The proposed schedule for the MXT feature is as follows:
- Research and design: 2 weeks
- Development and testing: 8 weeks
- Integration with existing Weights and Biases features: 2 weeks
- User testing and feedback: 2 weeks
- Final testing and release: 2 weeks

## 10. Success Criteria
