# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview
The Model Explainability Toolkit (MXT) is a new feature that will be added to Weights and Biases, a leading AI startup specializing in experiment tracking, data versioning, hyperparameter tuning, and much more. The purpose of this project is to enable users to interpret and explain the outputs and decision-making of their AI models. This feature will help users gain insights into how their models work and make better decisions based on those insights.

## 2. Project Scope
The MXT feature will include the following:
- Ability to explain the outputs and decision-making of AI models
- Integration with existing Weights and Biases features
- User-friendly interface for easy interpretation of model outputs
- Compatibility with popular machine learning frameworks

The following are excluded from the project scope:
- Integration with non-popular machine learning frameworks
- Support for non-AI models

## 3. Functional Requirements
The MXT feature should deliver the following functionalities:
- Ability to generate explanations for model outputs
- Ability to visualize the explanations in a user-friendly manner
- Integration with existing Weights and Biases features
- Compatibility with popular machine learning frameworks

## 4. Non-functional Requirements
The MXT feature should meet the following criteria:
- Performance: The feature should not significantly impact the performance of the AI models.
- Security: The feature should not compromise the security of the user's data.
- Usability: The feature should be easy to use and understand.
- Scalability: The feature should be able to handle large datasets and models.

## 5. Use Cases
The following are detailed scenarios that describe how users will interact with the MXT feature:
- A user trains an AI model and wants to understand how the model is making its predictions. The user can use the MXT feature to generate explanations for the model outputs.
- A user wants to compare the explanations generated by different models. The user can use the MXT feature to visualize the explanations side-by-side.

## 6. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Guidelines
The MXT feature should adhere to the following design principles and requirements:
- The UI should be intuitive and easy to use.
- The UX should be consistent with the existing Weights and Biases features.
- The UI should be customizable to allow users to choose the level of detail they want to see in the explanations.

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints
The following factors or limitations may impact the development or implementation of the MXT feature:
- The feature may not work with all machine learning frameworks.
- The feature may not work with all types of AI models.
- The feature may require additional computational resources.

## 8. Technical Requirements
The MXT feature will require the following technologies, platforms, or infrastructure:
- Integration with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
- Additional computational resources to generate explanations for large datasets and models.

## 9. Timeline and Milestones
The proposed schedule for the MXT feature is as follows:
- Research and design: 2 weeks
- Development and testing: 8 weeks
- Integration with existing Weights and Biases features: 2 weeks
- User testing and feedback: 2 weeks
