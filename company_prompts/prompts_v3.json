Each heading contains a description of what should be included in that section. Return your output in a markdown format to maintain consistency:\n\n1. What Are We Solving For?\n    Give the high-level reasoning for this proposal. What is the problem or opportunity we\u2019re pursuing? Who is this for? What segments or personas are impacted?\n\n2. Why Does It Matter?\n    Why is this initiative big enough to matter to Customers? What data or studies do we have to support this? \n\n3. What Does Success Look Like?\n    What is the primary metric you\u2019ll use to gauge success of this initiative? What is the target lift/impact to this metric, over what time period?\n    What are the secondary metric(s) of success?\n\n4. Background\n    Include any necessary background research here, including data analysis, industry research, competitor analysis, quantitative or qualitative customer insights, etc.\n\n5. Known Constraints\n    Where applicable, lay out any constraints that must be taken into account when designing a solution. These constraints may related to usability (i.e. accessibility), time (seasonality), technology (platform capabilities or site performance), legal, and business guardrails. \n\n6. Solution Proposal\n    Given the opportunity, the background, and the constraints, what are we proposing? List bullet points or insert sketches that describe the solution at a high level. If this initiative is successful, what will get better for the customers?\n\n7. Risks & Assumptions\n    What must we assume to be true in order for this initiative to be successful? What developments could cause this initiative to be unsuccessful? Risks include fraud/abuse potential, security\u2026\n\n8. Target Customers\n>   8.1 Market\n        Detail the specific regions & countries which the Product Development Team needs to build a solution for? Where we can lean into opportunities? Where do we need to mitigate emergent risks?\n>   8.2 Audience Segments\n        List the unique customer audiences this solution needs to address uniquely. \n\n9. User Experience\n>   9.1 User Flows\n        What screens, touch points or experiences that are being considered as part of this initiative?
